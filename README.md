# Thoughts about Metrics

This is to have a place to save some thoughts about metrics, notably Prometheus.
These are likely rather vague, incomplete and not cecessarily well thought through. The idea is to save them somewhere accessible during the thought process or for later. Please donâ€™t understand them as good advice, just because they are written down here.
